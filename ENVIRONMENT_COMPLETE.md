## 🎯 HOW TO USE

### After Every Restart
1. Read `00-READ_ME_FIRST.md` (or let system remind you)
2. Read `STARTUP.md`
3. Read `ACCESS_REGISTRY.md`
4. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Before Using Any Tool
1. Check `ACCESS_REGISTRY.md` for status
2. If ⚠️, read the notes section
3. Know what works and what doesn't
4. Be honest about limitations

### Common Tasks
- **Status check:** `./TOOLS/status-check.sh`
- **New project:** `./TOOLS/setup-project.sh`
- **Find command:** Check `CHEAT_SHEET.md`
- **Quick reference:** Check `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

## ✅ PROBLEMS SOLVED

### Before: Memory Loss
❌ "I forgot what tools I have"

✅ **Now:** ACCESS_REGISTRY.md has complete inventory with status

### Before: Access Confusion  
❌ "I can't access Coolify"

✅ **Now:** "Coolify token lacks deployment permissions. I can read status but cannot deploy. Need dashboard login or new token."

### Before: Context Reset Panic
❌ "What was I working on?"

✅ **Now:** Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for daily logs, MEMORY.md for big picture

### Before: Tool Status Unknown
❌ "Does SSH work?"

✅ **Now:** Check ACCESS_REGISTRY.md - Key exists but not authorized on server

### Before: Commands Forgotten
❌ "How do I use mcporter?"

✅ **Now:** CHEAT_SHEET.md has every command organized by task

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Documentation is memory** - Write everything down
2. **Status must be explicit** - ✅/⚠️/❌ with explanations
3. **Honesty > excuses** - "I cannot because X" is better than "it's complicated"
4. **Check before claiming** - Never say broken without checking registry
5. **Startup protocol matters** - Always read the files after restart
