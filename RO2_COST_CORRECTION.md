# 💰 Renderowl 2.0 - Cost Correction

## Previous Estimates Were Wrong!

The DevOps team estimated:
- **Staging:** $430/month
- **Production:** $3,000/month

**These were based on cloud hosting (AWS/GCP), NOT your own server!**

---

## ✅ Actual Costs (Running on Your Coolify Server)

### What You're Already Paying:
- **VPS Server:** (you already have this)
- **Coolify:** Free (self-hosted)

### Additional Costs for RO2:

| Item | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Cloudflare R2 Storage** | ~$5-15/mo | For video files (1-5TB) |
| **AI API Usage** | ~$20-100/mo | OpenAI/Together for AI features |
| **Bandwidth** | $0 | Included with VPS or R2 |
| **Total** | **~$25-115/mo** | vs $3,000/mo for cloud! |

---

## 🔧 Server Requirements

### Minimum for RO2:
- **CPU:** 4 cores
- **RAM:** 8GB
- **Disk:** 100GB

### Recommended:
- **CPU:** 8 cores
- **RAM:** 16GB
- **Disk:** 200GB SSD

## ❓ Need Your Input

@kay - What's your current VPS specs?

Please share:
1. **CPU cores:** ?
2. **RAM:** ?GB
3. **Disk:** ?GB
4. **Current monthly cost:** ?

If your current server is underpowered, we can:
1. **Upgrade existing VPS** (probably +$10-20/mo)
2. **Add a worker server** for video processing ($20-40/mo)

## 🎉 The Good News

**Running on your own server is ~95% cheaper than cloud!**

Instead of $3,000/month, you're looking at:
- **~$25-115/month** for a fully functional RO2
- **~$50-150/month** with a dedicated worker

**Savings: $2,850+/month** 💰
