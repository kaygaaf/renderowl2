# CRITICAL LESSONS - DO NOT FORGET

## User Explicitly Told Me:
1. **ONLY Kimi model** - No fallbacks, no Claude, no OpenAI
2. **Timeout is THE issue** - Not concurrency, not model choice
3. **Use skills** - Read SKILL.md before using tools
4. **Use MCP** - mcporter for Coolify, not curl

## Mistakes I Keep Making:
- [ ] Forgetting to read skills before using tools
- [ ] Using curl instead of mcporter for Coolify
- [ ] Changing concurrency when timeout is the issue
- [ ] Not testing before claiming "it works"
- [ ] Treating memory as "optional reference" instead of "required reading"

## Systems Created to Prevent This:
1. **REMINDER.md** - Read before every task
2. **AGENTS.md** - Updated with mandatory checklist
3. **Preflight script** - Run to check available tools

## What I Must Do Differently:
- STOP and READ before acting
- USE mcporter for Coolify operations
- TEST with browser/curl before saying it works
- FOLLOW the checklist, don't skip it

## Current Renderowl Status:
- API: Running with API key auth for videos
- Frontend: Deployed, uses API key auth
- Issue: Video playback still needs verification

## Access I Have But Don't Use:
- ✅ MCP: mcporter for Coolify
- ✅ CLI: gh for GitHub
- ✅ CLI: openclaw gateway commands

## Commitment:
I will read REMINDER.md and run preflight checks before EVERY task.
