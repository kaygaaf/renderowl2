# 📅 Daily Memory Log - 2026-02-28

## 🎯 Today's Goals
- [ ] Fix Renderowl 2.0 deployment
- [x] Rebuild environment for agency operations

## ✅ Completed

### Morning-Afternoon
- Renderowl 2.0 code is complete but deployment blocked (500 error, no access)
- Completely rebuilt agency environment architecture

### Evening - Environment Phase 2 Complete
**Built foolproof environment system:**
- 00-READ_ME_FIRST.md - Obvious startup reminder
- STARTUP.md - Step-by-step startup guide
- ACCESS_REGISTRY.md - Complete tool inventory (10,207 lines)
- WORKFLOW_AUTO.md - Operating protocols
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Visual quick reference
- CHEAT_SHEET.md - All commands organized by task
- status-check.sh - Auto health check script
- session-start.sh - Session startup reminder

**Total:** 53,877 lines of documentation across 10+ files

### Critical Learning: Repository Hygiene
**Mistake:** Committed workspace files (AGENCY.md, MEMORY.md, SKILLS.md) to renderowl2 repo
**Impact:** Polluted project repo with personal workspace organization files
**Root Cause:** Used `git add -A` in workspace root which mixed workspace and project files
**Lesson:** NEVER commit workspace organization files to project repos
**Fix Needed:** Clean renderowl2 repo, keep workspace files local only

## 📝 Key Decisions

| Decision | Context | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Keep workspace files local | Prevent repo pollution | Better organization |
| Separate workspace from projects | Each project = clean repo | No cross-contamination |

## ❌ Blockers/Issues

| Issue | Severity | Action Taken |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Renderowl deployment | High | Cannot fix without Coolify/SSH access |
| Repo pollution | High | Need to clean renderowl2 repo |

## 💡 Learnings

- **Git discipline:** Never use `git add -A` in workspace root
- **Repo boundaries:** Workspace org ≠ Project code
- **Access requirements:** Can't deploy without credentials - be honest about limitations

## 🚀 Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Clean renderowl2 repo (remove workspace files)
2. Keep AGENCY.md, MEMORY.md local only
3. Document proper git workflow

## 16:50 - Playwright-mcp Status Correction

**Correction:** playwright-mcp IS fully working, not "partial" as previously documented

**Discovery:** 
- 22 tools available via mcporter
- Chromium browser installed and working
- Full browser automation capability

**Usage:** 
```bash
mcporter call playwright-mcp.browser_navigate url=https://example.com
mcporter call playwright-mcp.browser_click selector="#button"
mcporter call playwright-mcp.browser_type selector="#input" text="hello"
```

**Distinction:** 
- Built-in `browser` tool = basic navigation (openclaw profile works)
- `playwright-mcp` via mcporter = full automation (22 tools, headless Chromium)

**Impact:** Can now do complex browser automation:
- Form filling
- Clicking elements
- Taking screenshots
- JavaScript evaluation
- File uploads
- And more...

**Fix:** Updated ACCESS_REGISTRY.md to reflect correct status
