- Bootstrapped new OpenClaw main session with Kay; chose name **Antigravity** (🛸) as "right hand" assistant.
- Verified local GitHub CLI already authenticated as `kaygaaf`; access to repos via `gh`.
- Captured Kay-provided credentials for:
  - Coolify VPS: `91.98.168.113` user `root` (password provided in chat) and Coolify API key `6|FWL8f...`.
  - n8n API key (JWT) provided.
- Updated workspace `TOOLS.md` with Coolify + n8n credentials/status.
- Tested Coolify API at `http://91.98.168.113:8000/api/v1/...` successfully; listed projects (e.g., N8N, kayorama site, Fullvidgen, etc.).
- Tested n8n API at `https://n8n.kayorama.nl/api/v1/workflows` successfully; retrieved workflow details for "Short form history" and others.
- Noted: Attempted to query VidAI status endpoint with guessed auth headers; consistently got 401 "Could not validate credentials". Health endpoint works without auth.
- Identified in n8n workflow that VidAI generate calls use n8n credential `httpHeaderAuth` named "Header Auth account 2" (credential id `Kzze5qNf20bk5fht`), but n8n API does not allow fetching that credential via GET.


- Group chat (clawdie): Kay asked to run the previous plan; created forum topics per subagent. Kay requested I keep better project mapping memory to avoid confusion; action item: maintain a workspace project map (repos/folders for lattice plugins + vidai) in a non-sensitive file (e.g., PROJECTS.md) and keep it updated.
