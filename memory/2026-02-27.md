## 15:09 - Memory Flush (Trello Setup Issues)

### Trello Setup Issues
- Created 5 Trello boards for Renderowl teams
- User couldn't access boards (private/not shared)
- Added user's member ID to all boards
- Made main board public
- User still can't see boards
- **Issue**: User needs to generate Token (not just API Key + Secret)
- **Next**: Get Token from Trello to recreate boards properly

### Current Status
- API: Down/unstable (crash loop)
- Trello: Partial setup, needs Token
- Renderowl: Cannot work until API stable

### Action Items
1. Get Trello Token from user
2. Recreate boards with correct auth
3. Fix API crash loop (CRITICAL)
4. Then resume normal development

## 15:27 - Memory Flush (Trello Setup SUCCESS)

### Trello Setup COMPLETE ✅
- User provided correct Token: `ATTA0adfa2475a7e7b5fb7c03d13416d6d5b3bd759757b75affd0d01527d296af7b808B01EC2`
- Token tested and works (kay van dijk, kayvandijk1)
- Created 5 public boards successfully:
  1. 🎯 Renderowl Development (Main) - https://trello.com/b/67c04e6d7f4cf2a0cdc98e9e
  2. 🚀 DevOps & Infrastructure - https://trello.com/b/67c04e6e8987a4a0df35f068
  3. ⚙️ Backend API - https://trello.com/b/67c04e702d343f2ff985b968
  4. 🎨 Frontend & UI - https://trello.com/b/67c04e70ab9b3eaff3e8700c
  5. 🧪 QA & Testing - https://trello.com/b/67c04e71c0fef255cc0e267d
- Added lists (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Blocked, Done)
- Added cards to main board:
  - 🚧 BLOCKED: API Crash Loop, Video Playback
  - 📋 BACKLOG: Deploy Analytics, Deploy Templates

### Trello Credentials (stored in .trello-env)
- API Key: 9035f71851deb35bb92d2715c84867a3
- Token: ATTA0adfa2475a7e7b5fb7c03d13416d6d5b3bd759757b75affd0d01527d296af7b808B01EC2

### Current Status
- Trello: ✅ Fully operational
- API: 🚨 Still in crash loop (55+ restarts)
- Renderowl: Blocked until API stable

### Key Lesson
- Trello API requires **Token** (not Secret) for personal use
- Secret is only for OAuth apps
- Token is generated by clicking "Token" link on API key page

### Next Actions
1. Fix API crash loop (PRIORITY #1)
2. Deploy Analytics API once stable
3. Deploy Templates API once stable
4. Resume normal feature development
